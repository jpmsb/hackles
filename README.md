# Hackles

## About
[Hackles](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015091950/http://www.hackles.org/) is a web comic strip series created by [Drake Emko](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015094542/http://www.hackles.org/etc/drake.html) & [Jen Brodzik](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015094512/http://www.hackles.org/etc/jen.html), that features animals working in a big tech company called BitCo. The strip makes fun about situations that happen in the office and in the geek world. It was published online from March 31, 2001 to January 15, 2004. Below, you can read more about:

## This project

This project aims to bring the Hackles comic strip to new audiences, while being a side-project I like working on to improve my programming skills. I used to read this comic in Brazilian Portuguese, translated by Marcelo Toscani Brand√£o, back in 2011, at the defunct [tirinhas.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014025043/http://www.tirinhas.com/) website. The icons used in the navigation buttons were retrieved from tirinhas.com as a tribute to the website that introduced me to this comic strip.

All the strips in this repository were retrieved from the archived hackles.org website.

The application presented here it's written in C and uses the Raylib library to do all the graphical stuff. [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is a simple and ease-to-use library that is used to make videogames.
