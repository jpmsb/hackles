Text: The good old days... Much like Hackles, Drake used to wear his [collars turned up](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015134949/http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/fashion/fa1475.php), as well as a fashionable 80's [mullet](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015134949/http://www.mulletsgalore.com/). Jen didn't look quite as atrocious, but she admits to wearing [jelly bracelets](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015134949/http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/memories/show_mem.php?ID=FA1836) and [legwarmers](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015134949/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~smendham/culture/legwarmers.html)!
