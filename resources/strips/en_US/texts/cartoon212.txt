[Hexley](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125036/http://www.hexley.com/) can drive at [Mach](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125036/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Darwin_kernel) speeds (haha), and [Beastie](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125036/http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/) is the more experienced veteran, but only [the penguin](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125036/http://www.nd.edu/~ljordan/linux/tuxgallery.html) has his own [racing game](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125036/http://www.tuxracer.com/)... ;-)
