Text: Marcus belittles the penguins' love lives.
Text: Tact is certainly not one of Marcus' strong points. The sad penguins in the third frame look absolutely heart-wrenching, we think. But then, we have a soft spot for penguins (and dateless geeks in general, don't you know).
Text: Semi-interesting fact: This cartoon will go down in history as the first strip where Percy and Pete actually utter something pronounceable (normally, they just speak in pictures/symbols and scowl a lot). Sure, it's only the sound "Quork," but, you know, one "Quork" is worth a thousand words. Or so we've heard.
