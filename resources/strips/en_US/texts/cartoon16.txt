Text: It's our Web Comics Awareness Day strip!
Text: Spread the word about Web comics! Tell one, tell all! Web cartoonists put a lot of hard work into creating stuff for your entertainment, usually for no pay. Support your favorite cartoonist by letting him/her know how much you enjoy their comic (we could all use some encouragement!). And visit http://wca2001.keenspace.com to see what other cartoonists have done to celebrate our favorite form of expression. It's fun and educational!
