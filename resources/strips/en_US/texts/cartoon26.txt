Text: Our tribute to Star Trek Voyager.
Text: Looks like Marcus failed the nerd test. Honestly though, Voyager had its ups and downs. Some episodes (including the finale) rocked, while many others had plots that were far too contrived and morally heavy-handed. But we have good memories of when we lived in Florida- we'd go to our friends' house and watch the show every Wednesday night. It was a cool tradition.
