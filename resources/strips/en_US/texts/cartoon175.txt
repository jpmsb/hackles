Text: Could one play [NetHack](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015141452/http://www.nethack.org/) with only one's snout (or nose, if you will)?

Although we never played much NetHack, Drake does have a weakness for old-school [text adventures](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015141452/http://www.xyzzynews.com/), such as the [Scott Adams](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015141452/http://www.lysator.liu.se/adventure/Adventure_International/Classic.html) (not the Dilbert guy!) classics.
