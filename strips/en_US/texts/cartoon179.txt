Text: We had a mild debate over the spelling of "luser", having forgotten the hax0r way to spell it. The version in panel 3 is based on [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015131051/http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/l/luser.html) interesting [jargon](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015131051/http://info.astrian.net/jargon/) entry, which settled the debate. Fun and educational - that's what Hackles is all about.
