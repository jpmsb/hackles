Text: What is the best search engine?
Text: It seems that even [Jeeves](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015111124/http://www.askjeeves.com/) himself doesn't recommend Ask Jeeves. Jen always thought [Dogpile](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015111124/http://www.dogpile.com/) was cool because it gives you the search results from over 20 search engines. Of course nowadays, there is no reason to use anything besides the inimitable [Google](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015111124/http://www.google.com/) (Don't tell Preston, though!).
