Text: Vic shows off his robot pride.
Text: It's pretty much a clich√© that in every movie with a [robot](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125400/http://www.splicedonline.com/99reviews/bicentennial.html), android, [hologram](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125400/http://members.aol.com/rpicardo/holodoc.html), or borg, the "artificial" life form wants to experience human feelings. It's an obvious case of script writers imposing their human values on creatures that, realistically, shouldn't care less about our impractical emotions. Any [robot worth its salt](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015125400/http://world.honda.com/robot/) does its work with cold, emotionless efficiency. Vic doesn't count.
