Text: Breaking news: mystery squid discovered!
Text: Yes, there really is a giant [mystery squid](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015140628/http://npr.org/programs/atc/features/2001/dec/squid/011220.squid.html) (make sure to check out the awesome video footage). Ever since we learned about this, Drake has been combing the Web obsessively for new [squid information](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015140628/http://zapatopi.net/cephnews.html). Naturally, we had to make a comic about it.
