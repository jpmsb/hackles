Text: Incidentally can you guess which games are [the most popular](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015133618/http://www.eurogamer.net/content/pr_prison) in UK prisons? Not surprisingly [Tomb Raider](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015133618/http://www.larainmotion.com/traod11.jpg) tops the chart. It's also interesting (and a little scary) to think about hardened criminals passing the time playing [Grand Theft Auto 3](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015133618/http://www.gta3.com/?zone=images&gal=1&pg=1&name=5.jpg). Talk about a bad influence!
