Text: Marcus has a secret.
Text: The inspiration for this comic came from a children's book that we read in an airport bookstore. Drake liked the scene in [Dogs Don't Wear Glasses](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015133652/http://www.interlinkbooks.com/Dogs_Dont_Wear_Glasses.html) where the poor dog gets a close shave on his head, exposing a pink scalp. The next day Drake had the idea of drawing a bald Marcus, not remembering where he got the idea from. Funny how the mind works.
