Text: Vic's explanation of the flawed science in The Matrix is, I believe, correct. Since the total [entropy of the universe always increases](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015112041/http://www.panspermia.org/seconlaw.htm), it will always take more energy to grow life forms than can be harvested from them. In our world, unlike that of the Matrix, the sun provides us with free energy, which we can use inefficiently. Yes, real science is less fun than science fiction :-).
